# Easy link to sacoronavirus.co.za

To help ensure that South Africans get official, up-to-date information about COVID-19, and to fight fake news and misleading stories, the government has made it compulsory for all domains that end in `.za` to include a visible link to [sacoronavirus.co.za](https://sacoronavirus.co.za) on their landing page. This site is the government's official 'Covid-19 South African Online Portal'.

This Wordpress plugin implements a link to the portal **quickly and easily**. Once activated, your site will show a small tab that users can close. It will stay closed for that visit (or 'session').

This script is tiny (less than 3KB), and does not collect or transmit any data.

## To use

Install and activate this plugin in your wordpress installation.

### Options

Configure the plugin from the `Coronavirus` menu that will appear in your Wordpress admin once activated.

You can configure the following properties:

- `Home Page`: if checked, the tab will appear only on the Home Page of your site.
- `backgroundColor`: the background colour of the tab (by default, this is white).
- `font`: the name of the font you want to use by default. The script does not load any fonts, so this should be the name of a font already available on your website.
- `size`: a decimal number by which the tab's size should be multiplied to make it bigger or smaller.
- `textColor`: the colour of the tab's text and icons (by default, this is `#222`, almost black).
- `top`: if you want to position the tab vertically, the distance from the top of the page (by default, the tab is 1rem from the bottom of the page).
